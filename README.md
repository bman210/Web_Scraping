# Web_Scraping

This repository contains all information and work relevant to HW Module 12. The two jupyter notebook files with the 'HW' tag at the end of them contain all of my work and amassed data for this assignment. 

As an aside, on my first submission there was an issue with gihubs interaction with my soup.prettify code and it did not show all the work i performed in the mars_weather_HW. I will resubmit with the work I have I am sorry for any inconvenience. The soup.p[rettify portion has been commented out.
